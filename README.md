# Simulations Using Spectre
This tutorial introduces the use of Cadence for schematic capture, simulation, layout, and post-layout verification. In this tutorial, the Calibre tool is employed for Design Rule Checking (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification, and parasitic extraction, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the design.
